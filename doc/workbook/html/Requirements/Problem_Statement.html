      traditional "black-box" vulnerability scanners were

      be able to perform user authentication (forms and HTTP NTLM

      The tool would then present the results of the spider and
      allow the user to delete or add applications. It would then
      perform a known files / application search. Essentially a
      whisker / cgi-scan search. We definitely do NOT want to use
      or have to be reliant on any other already developed tools.
      The checks it does in this section can be coded into an XML
      file (VulnXML Format) for extensibility. We can take the
      best of known databases like whisker as well as CVE and the
      other well documented lists. As well as looking for
      vulnerable files, the tool would also run the actual
      exploits of those vulnerable files if they were found to
      avoid false positives.</FONT>

      the spider / file enumeration and build relevant
      tests.</FONT>
    
</P>
<P>
      
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would imagine
      this would be a set of data tests, for example were there
      any ODBC errors seen anywhere then build SQL injection
      tests, or if any cookies then.Each test would
      probably be a unique class implementing specific data tests
      son the data tests could be written and modified without
      affecting anything else in the application.</FONT>
    
</P>
<P>
      
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The application
      should then essentially build a selection of relevant tests
      for the applications it found and present them to the user
      in the form of predefined configurations i.e. checked boxes
      saying it will do these tests on these URLS. A user could
      then override the suggested checks and select all if so
      desired.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This logic would
      obviously be pretty complex. Take for examples cookies.
      Poisoning cookies is almost like exhaustive key space
      unless you have some cool parsing algorithms. Maybe we
      could have some configuration options like manipulate
      integer values or try these ranges within these strings
      etc. These would be user defined by the test module so if a
      tester has time and wants to try all possible combinations
      he could.</FONT>
