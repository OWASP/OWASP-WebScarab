<h3>Control Standards</h3>
<p>Control Standards dictate which controls should be used for particular types of information
	in presentation.  It attempts to define which choices we will make for different interaction
	needs.  For example, when presented with a Yes/No selection, we should use a check-box.  A
	short list of selections should check-boxes or radio buttons (if mutually exclusive).  The
	following is the list:</p>

<h3>Product/Process Window Standards</h3>
<p>The product/process window standards define how the different products (if we use a product
	focus) and processes (if we use a process focus) will be designed.  For the most part, there isn't
	much of this in our system since we have a very non-business oriented system.  In the business
	world, everything is easily broken down into process or product.  They are designed to reduce
	the amount of interaction that a user is allowed to do in order to reduce error rates.</p>
<p>In the application there are a few places where a process is used.  Wizard interfaces are
	to be used whenever the interface requires many choices or where the interaction is fairly
	complex.  We should also decide to focus on the process in these instances.  For example,
	if the user wants to manage the list of keys they know about, they would be presented with 
	a fairly dynamic interface.  But, handling the first start-up of the application where the
	user must set certain options should be done with a wizard.</p>
<h3>Dialog Box Standards</h3>
<p>Dialog box standards are designed to set how dialogs should be organized and colored 
	on the interface.  Such things as the fonts used, where buttons are located, how menus are
	organized, and so on.</p>
<p>The following list is taken from [Mayhew, 2001].</p>
<ul>
	  
<li>Always use default colors of the widget set.</li>
	  
<li>Match Title bar to the menu bar selection that brought it up, left justified in the title bar.</li>
	  
<li>Create vertical groups of logical related fields</li>
	  
<li>Within field groups, left-align captions, left-align fields, try to minimize white space between captions and fields (through careful labeling), use first-letter caps for all main words in captions, include a colon immediately following each caption.</li>
	  
<li>Use group boxes, embed all-caps titles in upper left of group box.</li>
	  
<li>Order groups left to right, top to bottom according to natural order or expected frequency of use.</li>
	  
<li>Use white space to set off and reinforce groups.</li>
	  
<li>Right-justify or decimal-align numbers and currency <i>upon display</i> (allow left-justified input).</li>
	  
<li>Never use scroll bars in dialog boxes.</li>
	  
<li>Background colors for fields:</li>
	  
<ul>
	    
<li>Read-only -- medium grey</li>
	    
<li>Required -- white</li>
	    
<li>Optional -- dark grey</li>
	  
</ul>
	  
<li>Use consistent labels for common fields.</li>
	  
<li>Use consistent display format for all dates:  Jan 1, 20000</li>
	  
</ul>
<h3>Message Box Standards</h3>
<p>Message box standards define how different pop-up messages are organized and which ones
	should be used for which.  For the most part, the messages should only be used to display 
	short announcements that the user must attend to.  These should be kept to a minimum so as not
	to interfere with the user's interaction with the interface.</p>
<h3>Input Device Interaction Standards</h3>
<p>The input device interaction standards describe how the user will use things like the
	keyboard and mouse.  There isn't much we can do as to these two since they are so controlled
	by the operating system.  The only guideline is to not violate the common key-bindings and
	the mouse button interactions that are used on the system, but to pick a common denomonator
	between the systems we may move the system to later.</p>
<p>Overall, this means that we have to avoid most key bindings, and most uses of the right
	mouse button.  This shouldn't be hard to do because of the simplicity of the interface.</p>
<h3>Feedback Standards</h3>
<p>The feedback standards define how we will provide feedback to the user's actions.  For 
	the most part, we will use color changes and changes in "depth" (3D appearance of buttons)
	to signify interaction.  Most of the default interactions provided by the widget set should
	be maintained, but any time when the interactions are confusing, they should be augmented.</p>
