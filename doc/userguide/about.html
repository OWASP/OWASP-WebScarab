<h1>About WebScarab</h1>
<p>WebScarab is a development project, run under the auspices of the
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). The aim of WebScarab is
to provide a free (beer as well as speech) tool for web application
developers and reviewers to use to understand the functioning of web
applications.</p>
<p>WebScarab is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.</p>
<p>WebScarab is based on a plugin architecture. Currently, the plugins 
are mostly security focused, but I'm sure that &quot;normal&quot; web 
developers would also be able to benefit from some of the plugins, such 
as the Proxy and Manual Request plugins.</p>
<p>WebScarab is a powerful tool, and as with many tools, can be used
for good as well as for bad. In the hands of the white-hats, WebScarab
can help them to find vulnerabilities, and make sure that those
vulnerabilities are fixed as soon as possible. In the hands of the
black-hats, WebScarab allows them to find and possibly exploit
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>WebScarab is a tool, nothing more. What you do with it is up to you.
My preference is to use it for good. But I can't stop you from using it
for evil.</p>
<p>That's what freedom is about.</p>
